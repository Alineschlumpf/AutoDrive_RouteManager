# Contributing to AutoDrive RouteManager
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing and also implementing new features

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache License 2.0
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [Apache License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/raupach/AutoDrive_RouteManager/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, config file, screenshot and log file

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary
- Submit a log file
- Submit your config file
- Steps to reproduce
- Make a screenshot
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.
